			Geralt of Rivia
		</div>
		<div class="text_of_character">
			Geralt of Rivia is a witcher and the main protagonist of the Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski and its adaptations, including The Witcher (PC), The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video games. Like all witchers, Geralt is a monster hunter for hire. He possesses superhuman abilities and is a master swordsman. During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.

			Geralt is also known as Gwynbleidd, meaning "White Wolf" in Elder Speech. He was given this alias by the dryads, and is also called the Butcher of Blaviken after an unfortunate incident in that town.

			Despite his title, Geralt does not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic.

			Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valour in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became a true knight of Lyria, only to lose the title soon after for departing.

		<div class="head_of_character">
			Yennefer of Vengerberg
		</div>
		<div class="text_of_character">
			Yennefer (born on Belleteyn of the year 1173) was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was the youngest member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and later the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, a former royal advisor to king Demavend of Aedirn, and a close friend of Triss Merigold.

			The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of The Tower of the Swallow she was 94 years old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.

			Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs. Yennefer's skin was as delicate as a sixteen-year-old girl. Her breasts were rounded and delicate, with nipples so pale that they were apparent only by their prominence.

	<div id="ciri">
		<div class="head_of_character">
			Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon
		</div>
			<div class="text_of_character">
			Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (also known as Ciri), was born in 1253 or 1252, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She is the Princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.

			After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny. Six years to the day after the child's birth, Geralt went back to Cintra for her, but did not take her with him to Kaer Morhen at that time. In fact, he didn't even lay eyes on her and only spoke with Calanthe, who divulged no information to him, not even the child's gender.

			While she was still an infant, Ciri's parents were both lost in a storm at sea and were presumed dead. She spent her youth in Cintra and Skellige under the care of her grandmother and her uncle.

	<div id="triss">
		<div class="head_of_character">
			Triss Merigold
		</div>
		</div>
			<div class="text_of_character">
			Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.

			She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter. Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.

			She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.

	<div id="dandelion">
		<div class="head_of_character">
			Dandelion
		</div>
		</div>
			<div class="text_of_character">
			About Dandelion's parentage not much is known, except that he is of noble birth. He is a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, royal instigator of Kerack.

			He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was "beaten into him with a cane". He made his first serious attempts to write poetry and compose at the age of 19.

			Dandelion studied seven liberal arts for four years at the Oxenfurt University, later becoming a professor he taught students for a year, and then left the academy to travel the world. He still visits Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.

			Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, and his best known song is the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.

			Dandelion first met Geralt in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later became Dol Blathanna, where they had their first adventure together, involving a nasty Sylvan and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the Elves. During this adventure, Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.

			At some point Dandelion offered his services to the Redanian Secret Service, though it seems his loyalty was dubious at the least, and he also collaborated with Temerian agents and special forces.

			During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his memoirs, entitled "Half a Century of Poetry"; twice, in fact. His first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon.

	<div id="eredin">
		<div class="head_of_character">
			Eredin Br√©acc Glas
		</div>
		</div>
			<div class="text_of_character">
			Despite being a notable strong soldier who was also skilled in magic, not much was known about his younger years.

			When King Auberon Muircetach, ruler of the Aen Elle elves, created the Red Riders, he appointed Eredin as their leader and general. Eredin, who at the time could access the Gate of the Worlds, allowing him to travel to different worlds at will, used the Gate and led the Red Riders in raiding many different worlds. Their main objective was to find and secure a sufficient number of humanoid - preferably human - slaves, that could serve the elves. Over time, this made Eredin and his men infamous and feared and they began to use magic to make themselves look even more menacing, like skeleton shaped armor and altering their voices.

			As time went on, they eventually rediscovered their original homeworld: the Aen Seidhe world where, prior to the Conjunction of the Spheres, all elves were from. However, it was now controlled by humans and since the Aen Elle had a deep hatred towards the race, the Aen Seidhe world became their primary target with Eredin often leading raids on the world and stealing a great number of young individuals. People from that world quickly started to fear the riders and they gave them a new name - the Wild Hunt. Because Eredin always led his men personally, he was present almost all the time and, as the lead rider, he caused the most fear in the common folk and soon they started to call him the King of the Wild Hunt.

			An unknown time later, the unicorns freed themselves from the grasp of the Aen Elle and took the Gate from them, meaning Eredin could no longer use it. This also caused all the elves to be stuck in their world with no access to more slaves and so they began to study the magic of traveling to different realms. However, they were only partially successful and created navigators - specialized mages trained to open portals to different worlds, but they could only transport a small group of riders. Due to this, the riders used spectral forms in place of physical and traveled in the skies as a cavalcade of specters.

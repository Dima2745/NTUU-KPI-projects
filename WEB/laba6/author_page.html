			"Andrzej Sapkowski jest pisarzem formatu Tolkiena, choć odeń różnym, bo zdecydowanie bliższym współczesności i obdarzony gorętszym słowiańskim temperamentem. Czytając Sapkowskiego, jesteśmy zarazem gdzieś w świecie Tolkiena, na seansie u przeinaczonego Disneya, w średniowieczu, u Sienkiewiczowskiego Zagłoby, na seminarium ekonomicznym, w krainie ponurych pogańskich obrzędów, w przemalowanej na baśniową scenerii z czarnego kryminału". <br>

		<div id="biography_inf">
			Sapkowski studied economics at the University of Łódź, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first short story, "The Witcher" ("Wiedźmin", also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine Fantastyka. In an interview he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize. The story was published in Fantastyka in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.

			The main character of "The Witcher" is Geralt, a mutant hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe. The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by Slavic mythology.
